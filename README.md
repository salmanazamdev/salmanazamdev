About me
--------
I design and ship end-to-end mobile experiences, from native modules and UI to backend APIs, payments, and deployment. I care about developer experience (TypeScript-first), performance, and clean UX. I publish production-ready templates and practical tutorials to help other devs ship faster.

Tech highlights
---------------
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, PLpgSQL, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby
- Mobile: React Native (CLI & Expo), native Android (Kotlin), native iOS (Swift/Obj-C)
- Backend: Node.js (Express/Nest), Supabase, PostgreSQL, REST + realtime
- Payments: Stripe (Payment Sheet)
- Infra & tooling: Docker, GitHub Actions, Firebase, CI, Jest, E2E testing (Detox)
- Favorite patterns: component-driven mobile architecture, modular coding patterns, typed APIs, reproducible Dockerized dev environments
